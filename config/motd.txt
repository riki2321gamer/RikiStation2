<h1>Welcome to Riki station 2!</h1>


<i>This server is a edited version of /tg/station. Discord : https://discord.gg/g7PFmhp</i>

<i>Source on github is being setup. Link : https://github.com/riki2321gamer/RikiStation1</i>
<i>-- RULES --
1. RP is completely allowed, RPing is not required but you can RP, I don't really care
2. OOC can be used for speaking about "where you are" "where you died" no restrictions.
3. You can ask for admins to spawn items if you want.
4. You can use adminhelp for game questions, etc and transformations, revives, etc
5. ERP is allowed. I don't really care.
6. Griefing is allowed, as long it doesn't mess with the round or annoy people, blowing up the station randomly (nukes) may not be allowed at all and may be received badly by admins.
7. You may take free items you see, everything is free around here, you can be anything you want, just have fun.
8. Please do not insult others in OOC. This rule should be common sense but flaming is not allowed at all and you will be kicked for it.
9. We only give you game master role if you're trustable enough/ Have been playing a lot.
10. On "Real" rounds, most of these rules don't apply anymore and no ahelps for free items allowed, get what's on the station.
11. I don't care about how old you are, there's no age restrictions in this server, as nobody really plays this game. We don't have a huge fanbase and we try to keep the server friendly enouhg.
12. (OBSOLETE RULE) No explosions. Keep them small atleast. It's hard re-building, we don't want to patch explosions or anything because of your fault.</i>
